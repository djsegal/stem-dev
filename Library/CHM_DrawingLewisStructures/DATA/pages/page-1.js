    Electrons in full energy levels do not form bonds.<br>
    For example, magnesium has 12 electrons. The first 10 are in filled<br>
    energy levels 1s, and 2s, 2p. These electrons do not form bonds.<br>
    The remaining 2 electrons are in the partly filled third energy level.<br>
    These electrons are the ones that form chemical bonds.<br><br>
    These two electrons are the valence electrons.`,
