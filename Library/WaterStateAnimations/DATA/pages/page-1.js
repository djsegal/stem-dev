  The phases of solid, liquid, and gas depend on the balance between the
  intermolecular forces and the energy in random motion.
  Intermolecular forces are attractive and tend to bring particles together.
  Random motion is disruptive, and tends to push parciels apart.
  The random motion increases with temperature. This is the source of thermal energy.`,
